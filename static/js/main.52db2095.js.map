Classes is one instance of nominative types in TypeScript and interfaces only check for shape, so it's hard to create unique type for every function call.\n *\n * We can use generic types via some param, like curve opts, but that would:\n *     1. Enable interaction between `curve(params)` and `curve(params)` (curves of same params)\n *     which is hard to debug.\n *     2. Params can be generic and we can't enforce them to be constant value:\n *     if somebody creates curve from non-constant params,\n *     it would be allowed to interact with other curves with non-constant params\n *\n * TODO: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-7.html#unique-symbol\n */\n\n// Instance for 3d XYZ points\nexport interface ProjPointType<T> extends Group<ProjPointType<T>> {\n  readonly px: T;\n  readonly py: T;\n  readonly pz: T;\n  get x(): T;\n  get y(): T;\n  multiply(scalar: bigint): ProjPointType<T>;\n  toAffine(iz?: T): AffinePoint<T>;\n  isTorsionFree(): boolean;\n  clearCofactor(): ProjPointType<T>;\n  assertValidity(): void;\n  hasEvenY(): boolean;\n  toRawBytes(isCompressed?: boolean): Uint8Array;\n  toHex(isCompressed?: boolean): string;\n\n  multiplyUnsafe(scalar: bigint): ProjPointType<T>;\n  multiplyAndAddUnsafe(Q: ProjPointType<T>, a: bigint, b: bigint): ProjPointType<T> | undefined;\n  _setWindowSize(windowSize: number): void;\n}\n// Static methods for 3d XYZ points\nexport interface ProjConstructor<T> extends GroupConstructor<ProjPointType<T>> {\n  new (x: T, y: T, z: T): ProjPointType<T>;\n  fromAffine(p: AffinePoint<T>): ProjPointType<T>;\n  fromHex(hex: Hex): ProjPointType<T>;\n  fromPrivateKey(privateKey: PrivKey): ProjPointType<T>;\n  normalizeZ(points: ProjPointType<T>[]): ProjPointType<T>[];\n}\n\nexport type CurvePointsType<T> = BasicWCurve<T> & {\n  // Bytes\n  fromBytes?: (bytes: Uint8Array) => AffinePoint<T>;\n  toBytes?: (c: ProjConstructor<T>, point: ProjPointType<T>, isCompressed: boolean) => Uint8Array;\n};\n\nfunction validatePointOpts<T>(curve: CurvePointsType<T>) {\n  const opts = validateBasic(curve);\n  ut.validateObject(\n    opts,\n    {\n      a: 'field',\n      b: 'field',\n    },\n    {\n      allowedPrivateKeyLengths: 'array',\n      wrapPrivateKey: 'boolean',\n      isTorsionFree: 'function',\n      clearCofactor: 'function',\n      allowInfinityPoint: 'boolean',\n      fromBytes: 'function',\n      toBytes: 'function',\n    }\n  );\n  const { endo, Fp, a } = opts;\n  if (endo) {\n    if (!Fp.eql(a, Fp.ZERO)) {\n      throw new Error('Endomorphism can only be defined for Koblitz curves that have a=0');\n    }\n    if (\n      typeof endo !== 'object' ||\n      typeof endo.beta !== 'bigint' ||\n      typeof endo.splitScalar !== 'function'\n    ) {\n      throw new Error('Expected endomorphism with beta: bigint and splitScalar: function');\n    }\n  }\n  return Object.freeze({ ...opts } as const);\n}\n\nexport type CurvePointsRes<T> = {\n  ProjectivePoint: ProjConstructor<T>;\n  normPrivateKeyToScalar: (key: PrivKey) => bigint;\n  weierstrassEquation: (x: T) => T;\n  isWithinCurveOrder: (num: bigint) => boolean;\n};\n\n// ASN.1 DER encoding utilities\nconst { bytesToNumberBE: b2n, hexToBytes: h2b } = ut;\nexport const DER = {\n  // asn.1 DER encoding utils\n  Err: class DERErr extends Error {\n    constructor(m = '') {\n      super(m);\n    }\n  },\n  _parseInt(data: Uint8Array): { d: bigint; l: Uint8Array } {\n    const { Err: E } = DER;\n    if (data.length < 2 || data[0] !== 0x02) throw new E('Invalid signature integer tag');\n    const len = data[1];\n    const res = data.subarray(2, len + 2);\n    if (!len || res.length !== len) throw new E('Invalid signature integer: wrong length');\n    // https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/57734 Leftmost bit of first byte is 'negative' flag,\n    // since we always use positive integers here.
